# Labmaker

The ultimate way to engage and interact with your community on a range of platforms. Labmaker is used to help grow a community & interact with them. The Reddit Bot & Admin Dashboard are designed to ambiguous, however the Discord & Tutor Dashboard is designed to interact specifically with tutors and students. They can be edited to suite your own needs but require more time to change than the Admin Dashboard & Reddit Bot.
